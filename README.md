# drum-kit
javascript day 1

## Description

This is the day 1 challenge from Javascript30 by Wes Bos where you code a drum kit using vanilla Javascript.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine using either the terminal (MacOS), or git bash (Windows). `cd` into the cloned folder and type `code . `. The project should open in any coding software of your choice. I recommend VSCode.

Navigate to the `index-START.html`. Click on it, then right click inside of it. Select `Open in Default Browser` or `Open with Live Server` if you have the extension. The drum kit will pop up in your default browser.


## Usage 

See the list of letters going from left to right. It matches the letting on your keyboard. Hit the key of the corresponding letter to activate the drum sound.
